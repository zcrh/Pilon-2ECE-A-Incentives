# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project üíª
## TASK üìî
Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about popular tracks on Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023). This task aims to analyze, visualize, and interpret the data to extract meaningful insights.

## GENERAL GUIDELINES üìí
1. Begin by familiarizing yourself with the structure of the dataset. Check for missing values and data types, and perform an initial exploration to understand the different features available.
2. Provide summary statistics to give an overview of key metrics such as the number of streams, release dates, and musical attributes (e.g., BPM, danceability).
3. Use appropriate visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms, scatter plots) to uncover trends and patterns in the data. Ensure that your plots are well-labeled and easy to interpret.
4. Investigate correlations between different variables and provide insights based on your findings. Explore relationships between streams and other musical characteristics like tempo, energy, or playlists.
5. Based on your analysis, offer any insights or recommendations regarding the tracks, artists, or musical trends that could be useful for understanding what makes a track popular.

## GUIDE QUESTIONS üñäÔ∏è

**Overview of Dataset**

1. How many rows and columns does the dataset contain?
2. What are the data types of each column? Are there any missing values?

**Basic Descriptive Statistics**

1. What are the mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams column?
2. What is the distribution of released_year and artist_count? Are there any noticeable trends or outliers?

**Top Performers**

1. Which track has the highest number of streams? Display the top 5 most streamed tracks.
2. Who are the top 5 most frequent artists based on the number of tracks in the dataset?

**Temporal Trends**
1. Analyze the trends in the number of tracks released over time. Plot the number of tracks released per year.
2. Does the number of tracks released per month follow any noticeable patterns? Which month sees the most releases?

**Genre and Music Characteristics**

1. Examine the correlation between streams and musical attributes like bpm, danceability_%, and energy_%. Which attributes seem to influence streams the most?
2. Is there a correlation between danceability_% and energy_%? How about valence_% and acousticness_%?

**Platform Popularity**

1. How do the numbers of tracks in spotify_playlists, deezer_playlists, and apple_playlists compare? Which platform seems to favor the most popular tracks?

**Advanced Analysis**

1. Based on the streams data, can you identify any patterns among tracks with the same key or mode (Major vs. Minor)?
2. Do certain genres or artists consistently appear in more playlists or charts? Perform an analysis to compare the most frequently appearing artists in playlists or charts.
