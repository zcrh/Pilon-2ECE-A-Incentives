# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project üíª
## TASK üìî
Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about popular tracks on Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023). This task aims to analyze, visualize, and interpret the data to extract meaningful insights.

## GENERAL GUIDELINES üìí
1. Begin by familiarizing yourself with the structure of the dataset. Check for missing values and data types, and perform an initial exploration to understand the different features available.
2. Provide summary statistics to give an overview of key metrics such as the number of streams, release dates, and musical attributes (e.g., BPM, danceability).
3. Use appropriate visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms, scatter plots) to uncover trends and patterns in the data. Ensure that your plots are well-labeled and easy to interpret.
4. Investigate correlations between different variables and provide insights based on your findings. Explore relationships between streams and other musical characteristics like tempo, energy, or playlists.
5. Based on your analysis, offer any insights or recommendations regarding the tracks, artists, or musical trends that could be useful for understanding what makes a track popular.

### Insights üí°
The descriptive statistics on streams suggest a right-skewed distribution with a small number of popular songs, which receive an equal amount of streams. Most songs likely have stream counts closer to the median, with only a few reaching numbers near or above the mean.

Regarding the distribution of released year, there has been an increase in songs released in recent years, especially from around 2020 onwards, indicating a surge in releases during this period. The frequency of releases in the latest years is an outlier compared to previous years, suggesting an accelerated rate of releases.

On the other side, the distribution of artist count is heavily skewed toward single-artist releases, implying that most songs involve only one artist. Fewer collaborative releases are evident as more artists join, making these multi-artist collaborations rare occurrences.

```python
January had the highest number of releases with 133 tracks.
```

### Insights üí°
The graph showing the number of tracks released per year reveals a sharp rise in releases, particularly around 2020, with 2022 marking the peak year for track releases. Meanwhile, the monthly distribution of releases indicates that January had the highest number of releases, totaling 134 tracks. This pattern suggests seasonal trends in music release strategies, with higher numbers of releases at the beginning and middle of the year.

### Genre and Music Characteristics

1. Examine the correlation between streams and musical attributes like bpm, danceability_%, and energy_%. Which attributes seem to influence streams the most?
2. Is there a correlation between danceability_% and energy_%? How about valence_% and acousticness_%?

### Insights üí°
Key and Mode appear to have the most influence on streaming numbers, with key showing a notable correlation. This could mean that listeners may favor certain tonalities or moods associated with specific keys and modes. Liveness and other musical attributes contribute less significantly, with generally weak correlations, indicating that these factors alone are not major predictors of streaming success. 

Based on the Danceability and Energy correlation. They are somewhat positively correlated, meaning more danceable songs tend to be energetic. On the Valence and Acousticness correlation, it shows a weak inverse relationship, implying that more positive-sounding songs are minimally less acoustic, but the trend is not strong.
### Platform Popularity

1. How do the numbers of tracks in spotify_playlists, deezer_playlists, and apple_playlists compare? Which platform seems to favor the most popular tracks?

```
### Insights üí°
Spotify leads with nearly 5 million tracks in playlists, highlighting its popularity. In comparison, Deezer has significantly fewer tracks, and Apple Music features even fewer, suggesting a lesser focus on playlists. This data underscores Spotify's dominance in music discovery and playlisting, while other platforms struggle to compete with its vast database.

### Advanced Analysis

1. Based on the streams data, can you identify any patterns among tracks with the same key or mode (Major vs. Minor)?
2. Do certain genres or artists consistently appear in more playlists or charts? Perform an analysis to compare the most frequently appearing artists in playlists or charts.

### Insights üí°

The key C# exhibits the highest average streams, indicating that tracks in this key generally perform better in terms of streaming numbers. In contrast, the key A shows relatively lower average streams compared to other keys, suggesting it may be less popular or have fewer tracks with high streaming counts. Overall, while there is some variation among the keys, most tend to cluster around similar average stream values.

Tracks in Minor mode have slightly higher average streams compared to those in Major mode. This could suggest that Minor mode tracks are more popular, have higher engagement, or contain more high-stream tracks on average than Major mode tracks.

The graph "Top 15 Artists Appearances across Playlists and Charts" shows The Weeknd leading with over 140,000 appearances, followed closely by Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran. Other significant artists include Harry Styles, Eminem, and Arctic Monkeys. In contrast, artists like Pharrell Williams, Nile Rodgers, Daft Punk, and The Killers show significantly fewer appearances.
